# Hardware recommendations

For simplicity, we recommend a system which has been tested to work. Feel free to change this. But note that some configuration would be needed.


## OS and computer recommendation

The computer does not have to be overly powerful. We assume a unix type system, which has been tested on a Linux machine.

We have used a [Dell Precision 5720](http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/productdetails/precision-5720-aio/xctop5720aious "Dell Precision 5720 Store Page"), with 16 GB of RAM, i5-7600 processor and Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed.

The following commands should be run in a terminal `Ctrl + Alt + T` then be base software is up to date.

````bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade
